  <h2>🌷 Room 3: Tulip Room</h2>
  <div>
    <p><strong>1. Every Time I Say Your Name</strong><br>You bloom in syllables. Soft, sudden, unforgettable — like tulips do in spring.</p>
    <p><strong>2. The Color You Are</strong><br>If red is for love, and yellow for light — then you're the tulip that mixed both and called it us.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Bent Toward the Sun</strong><br>You never chase the spotlight. But somehow, it follows you — like tulips leaning toward what feels right.</p>
    <p><strong>4. On Quiet Days</strong><br>You don’t need to speak to grow. You stand still. And that’s when I notice how deeply you’ve taken root in me.</p>
    <p><strong>5. If I Were a Gardener</strong><br>I’d plant thousands of tulips. But I’d still walk right past them — because no bloom could match what I already have.</p>
